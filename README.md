# HarvestPlace - Agriculture Marketplace API (MVP)
# HarvestPlace API

HarvestPlace is a **backend API** for a simple agricultural marketplace. Farmers can list postharvest products, and retailers can browse and place orders quickly and effectively.

It aims to address the global challenge on Food Loss, and reducing the impact of this on the welfare of Nigerian farmers.

This MVP demonstrates **role-based access, authentication, and basic CRUD operations** using Django & Django REST Framework.
